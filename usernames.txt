Hard to critique this in any way, it's just such a warm experience to anonymously send words of encouragement to people. A great example about how much the UX/Design of a social media platform can affect how the community utilizes it.","image":{"url":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co1q4r.jpg"},"id":"backloggd-review-12212"},{"title":"Sludge Life (2020) - ★★★★","link":"https://www.backloggd.com/u/jlorp/review/9111/","pubDate":"Sun, 14 Jun 2020 23:30:38 +0000","description":"Love that world building &lt;3","image":{"url":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co28np.jpg"},"id":"backloggd-review-9111"},{"title":"The Signal From Tölva (2017) - unrated","link":"https://www.backloggd.com/u/jlorp/review/9100/","pubDate":"Sun, 14 Jun 2020 21:19:43 +0000","description":"Really like how this handles open-world ish design in first person.

I love how contained the beginning is, it wears its 70's horror influence on its sleeve (Especially Texas Chainsaw). The Car fight is possibly my favorite first person boss. Would love to play in VR sometime.","image":{"url":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co545w.jpg"},"id":"backloggd-review-9098"},{"title":"Animal Crossing: New Horizons (2020) - ★★★★","link":"https://www.backloggd.com/u/jlorp/review/9097/","pubDate":"Sun, 14 Jun 2020 21:10:05 +0000","description":"Poop is complete.","image":{"url":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co3wls.jpg"},"id":"backloggd-review-9097"}]}}
